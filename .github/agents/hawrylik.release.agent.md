TBD - always ask human gates
files:

- check version in pypi
- update changelog CHANGELOG.md
- make sure to include gruped commits (in general commits should be squasehd, one commit = one group but it might not always be the case), provide link to every commit
- version = "0.1.0"

Search for release in e.g. "CONTRIBUTING.md" and create notes in
docs/guide/release.md change links etc.
